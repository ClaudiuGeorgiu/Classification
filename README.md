# Classification

> Data classification using Accord.NET framework.

This is a simple `C#` application developed in Visual Studio (using WinForms GUI) to explore some of the functionalities of the [Accord.NET framework](http://accord-framework.net/) regarding data classification. You can import some data in `.csv` format and compare the performances of different classification algorithms.
